      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I love sweet potatoes if it wasn't obvious.  I've been cutting sugar out of my diet for a while now, 
        and the sweet potato gives me that sweet taste without the added processed sugars.  Oh and did I mention
        it's also healthy too?  I have a pretty simple recipe for it that you can easily memorize.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sweet potato (duh!)</li>
        <li>Asian 5 Spice (the cinnamon really kicks it into high gear)</li>
        <li>A dash of vegetable oil</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Peel and chop sweet potato to your liking.</li>
        <li>Place your chopped sweet potato in a mixing bowl.  Add a little bit of oil and season with Asian 5 Spice.  Mix well.</li>
        <li>Place seasoned sweet potato chunks on an oil baking sheet (I prefer to use wax paper)</li>
        <li>Set your oven to 400 degrees F and bake for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off oven and let cool for 2 minutes before serving.</li>
      </ol>
