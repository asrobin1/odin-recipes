    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Oh I remember the college days of microwaving ramen under the crushing weight of student loan debt.
       But just because you experience the existential dread of a late capitalist system doesn't mean you can't
       enjoy some instant noodles, and it doesn't mean you can't add a little pizazz either.  Again, we only do
       simple recipes here.  For the functional eater, this recipe is for you.
