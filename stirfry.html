      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Nothing makes me feel like a 5 star chef than the simplistic yet majestic art of crafting a stirfry.
        Okay maybe not a super chef, but I certainly enjoy the ease and taste of a good stirfry.  
        What I love most is how much flavor it brings to the vegetables and protein.  
        You can tailor a stirfry to whatever dietary needs you have.  
        Just remember to cook each ingredient separately with your leafy greens and noodles dead last!
