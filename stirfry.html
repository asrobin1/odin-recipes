      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Nothing makes me feel like a 5 star chef than the simplistic yet majestic art of crafting a stirfry.
        Okay maybe not a super chef, but I certainly enjoy the ease and taste of a good stirfry.  
        What I love most is how much flavor it brings to the vegetables and protein.  
        You can tailor a stirfry to whatever dietary needs you have.  
        Just remember to cook each ingredient separately with your leafy greens and noodles dead last!

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Protein: chicken, tofu, beef, etc.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: I prefer mushrooms, cole slaw, and spinach, but I've had great results with zucchini, squash, and snow peas!</li>
        <li>Sauce: 3 parts low sodium soy sauce, 1 part sesame oil, 1 part rice vinegar, 1 part oyster sauce, 1 part hoisin sauce.  I recommend a dash of Worchester sauce and a little ginger.</li>
        <li>Green onion for garnish at the end.</li>
        <li>Noodles of your choice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Prep all ingredients: boil noodles, mix sauce, cut veggies and protein.</li>
        <li>Grease a wok and cook protein on medium-high heat until light golden brown.  Separate your protein for later.</li>
        <li>Rinse and repeat with your vegetables.  NOTE: Do NOT cook your green onion!</li>
        <li>Turn your stove to medium-low heat and combine your protein, vegetables, and noodles.  Pour in your sauce and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Turn off your stove and garnish your dish with green onion.  Serve up your plate, and enjoy your meal.</li>
      </ol>
